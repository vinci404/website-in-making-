      <p>
        Philippines have a bunch of spoken languages but Tagalog is the most
        widespread language of the Central Philippine subfamily. Other prominent
        languages include Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, and Waray-Waray. Tausug
        is common in Palawan and the Sulu Archipelago, while Kapampangan and
        Pangasinan are spoken in central Luzon. Maguindanao and Maranao are
        notable languages in western Mindanao. Philippines, island country of
        Southeast Asia in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago
        consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets lying about 500 miles
        (800 km) off the coast of Vietnam. Manila is the capital, but nearby
        Quezon City is the country’s most-populous city. Both are part of the
        National Capital Region (Metro Manila), located on Luzon, the largest
        island. The second largest island of the Philippines is Mindanao, in the
        southeast. The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king
        of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th
        century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S.
        tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural
        affinities with the West. It is, for example, the second most-populous
        Asian country (following India) with English as an official language and
        one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia (the
        other being East Timor). Despite the prominence of such Anglo-European
        cultural characteristics, the peoples of the Philippines are Asian in
        consciousness and aspiration. The country was wracked by political
        turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. After enduring more
        than a decade of authoritarian rule under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, the
        broadly popular People Power movement in 1986 led a bloodless uprising
        against the regime. The confrontation resulted not only in the ouster
        and exile of Marcos but also in the restoration of democratic government
        to the Philippines. <br />

      <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center">Land</h2>
      <p>
        The Philippine archipelago is bounded by the Philippine Sea to the east,
        the Celebes Sea to the south, the Sulu Sea to the southwest, and the
        South China Sea to the west and north. The islands spread out in the
        shape of a triangle, with those south of Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago,
        and the island of Mindanao outlining (from west to east, respectively)
        its southern base and the Batan Islands to the north of Luzon forming
        its apex. Historically, the total number of islands in the archipelago
        was held to be 7,107, but in 2016 the National Mapping and Resource
        Information Authority of the Philippines announced the discovery of more
        than 500 previously uncharted islands. The archipelago stretches about
        1,150 miles (1,850 km) from north to south, and its widest east-west
        extent, at its southern base, is some 700 miles (1,130 km). The island
        of Taiwan lies north of the Batan group, the Malaysian portion of the
        island of Borneo is to the south of Palawan, and the eastern islands of
        Indonesia lie to the south and southeast of Mindanao. Only about
        two-fifths of the islands and islets have names, and only some 350 have
        areas of 1 square mile (2.6 square km) or more. The large islands fall
        into three groups: (1) the Luzon group in the north and west, consisting
        of Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan, (2) the Visayas group in the centre,
        consisting of Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Masbate, Negros, Panay, and Samar, and
        (3) Mindanao in the south. The alluvial plains and terraces of Luzon and
        Mindoro have dark black cracking clays, as well as younger soils that
        are especially suitable for rice cultivation. Much of the land of the
        hilly and mountainous regions consists of moist, fertile soils, often
        with a significant concentration of volcanic ash, that support fruit
        trees and pineapples. Oil palms, vegetables, and other crops are grown
        in the peatlike areas, as well as in the younger, sand-based soils of
        the coastal plains, marshes, and lake regions. The dark, organic,
        mineral-rich soils of the undulating terrain of the Bicol Peninsula,
        much of the Visayas, and the northwest tip of Luzon are used to grow
        coffee, bananas, and other crops. Highly weathered, often red or yellow
        soils are prominent in the central and southern Philippines and are
        typically planted with cassava (manioc) and sugarcane; these soils also
        support forests for timber harvesting. The poor, precipitation-leached
        soils of Palawan and the eastern mountains of Luzon are largely covered
        with shrubs, bushes, and other secondary growth that typically emerges
        in areas that have been cleared of their original forest cover. <br />

      <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center">Climate</h2>
      <p>
        The climate of the Philippines is tropical and strongly monsoonal (i.e.,
        wet-dry). In general, rain-bearing winds blow from the southwest from
        approximately May to October, and drier winds come from the northeast
        from November to February. Thus, temperatures remain relatively constant
        from north to south during the year, and seasons consist of periods of
        wet and dry. Throughout the country, however, there are considerable
        variations in the frequency and amount of precipitation. The western
        shores facing the South China Sea have the most marked dry and wet
        seasons. The dry season generally begins in December and ends in May,
        the first three months being cool and the second three hot; the rest of
        the year constitutes the wet season. The dry season shortens
        progressively to the east until it ceases to occur. During the wet
        season, rainfall is heavy in all parts of the archipelago except for an
        area extending southward through the centre of the Visayan group to
        central Mindanao and then southwestward through the Sulu Archipelago;
        rain is heaviest along the eastern shores facing the Pacific Ocean. From
        June to December tropical cyclones (typhoons) often strike the
        Philippines. Most of these storms come from the southeast, their
        frequency generally increasing from south to north; in some years the
        number of cyclones reaches 25 or more. Typhoons are heaviest in Samar,
        Leyte, south-central Luzon, and the Batan Islands, and, when accompanied
        by floods or high winds, they may cause great loss of life and property.
        Mindanao is generally free from such storms. November through February
        constitutes the most agreeable season; the air is cool and invigorating
        at night, and the days are pleasant and sunny. During the hot part of
        the dry season in most places—especially in the cities of Cebu, Davao,
        and Manila—the temperature sometimes rises as high as 100 °F (38 °C).
        Overall temperatures decline with elevation, however, and cities and
        towns located at higher elevations—such as Baguio in northern Luzon,
        Majayjay and Lucban south of Manila, and Malaybalay in central
        Mindanao—experience a pleasant climate throughout the year; at times the
        temperature in those places dips close to 40 °F (4 °C). <br />

      <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center">People and Life</h2>
      <p>
        Although many of the mountain regions and some of the lowlands remain
        heavily forested, the country’s forests have been shrinking rapidly for
        decades. Between the mid-20th century and the early 21st century, the
        country’s forestland was reduced by more than half—largely a result of
        logging, mining, and farming activities—and now accounts for less than
        one-fourth of the country’s total land area. Where forests remain in
        northern Luzon, the principal mountain tree is pine. In other areas,
        lauan (Philippine mahogany) often predominates. Most of the Philippines’
        vegetation is indigenous and largely resembles that of Malaysia; the
        plants and trees of the coastal areas, including the mangrove swamps,
        are practically identical with those of similar regions throughout the
        Malay Archipelago. Himalayan elements occur in the mountains of northern
        Luzon, while a few Australian types are found at various altitudes. The
        islands are home to thousands of species of flowering plants and ferns,
        including hundreds of species of orchids, some of which are extremely
        rare. Tall, coarse grasses such as cogon (genus Imperata) have arisen in
        many places where the forests have been burned away. The Philippines are
        inhabited by more than 200 species of mammals, including water buffalo
        (carabao), goats, horses, hogs, cats, dogs, monkeys, squirrels, lemurs,
        mice, pangolins (scaly anteaters), chevrotains (mouse deer), mongooses,
        civet cats, and red and brown deer, among others. The tamarau (Anoa
        mindorensis), a species of small water buffalo, is found only on
        Mindoro. Of more than 50 species of bats, many are peculiar to the
        Philippines. Fossil remains show that elephants once lived on the
        islands. Hundreds of species of birds live in the Philippines, either
        for all or part of the year. Prominent birdlife includes jungle fowl,
        pigeons, peacocks, pheasants, doves, parrots, hornbills, kingfishers,
        sunbirds, tailorbirds, weaverbirds, herons, and quails. Many species are
        endemic to the island of Palawan. The endangered Philippine eagle
        (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is limited mainly to isolated areas on Mindanao
        and in the Sierra Madre on Luzon. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The ethnically diverse people of the Philippines collectively are called
        Filipinos. The ancestors of the vast majority of the population were of
        Malay descent and came from the Southeast Asian mainland as well as from
        what is now Indonesia. Contemporary Filipino society consists of nearly
        100 culturally and linguistically distinct ethnic groups. Of these, the
        largest are the Tagalog of Luzon and the Cebuano of the Visayan Islands,
        each of which constitutes about one-fifth of the country’s total
        population. Other prominent groups include the Ilocano of northern Luzon
        and the Hiligaynon (Ilongo) of the Visayan islands of Panay and Negros,
        comprising roughly one-tenth of the population each. The Waray-Waray of
        the islands of Samar and Leyte in the Visayas and the Bicol (Bikol) of
        the Bicol Peninsula together account for another one-tenth. Filipino
        mestizos and the Kapampangans (Pampango) of south-central Luzon each
        make up small proportions of the population. Many smaller groups of
        indigenous and immigrant peoples account for the remainder of the
        Philippines’ population. The aboriginal inhabitants of the islands were
        the Negritos, a term referring collectively to numerous peoples of dark
        skin and small stature, including the Aeta, Ita, Agta, and others. Those
        communities now constitute only a tiny percentage of the total
        population. From the 10th century, contacts with China resulted in a
        group of mixed Filipino-Chinese descent, who also account for a minority
        of the population. Small numbers of resident Chinese nationals,
        emigrants from the Indian subcontinent, U.S. nationals, and Spanish add
        to the population’s ethnic and cultural diversity.

      <h2 style="display: flex; justify-content: center">Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Estimates of the total number of native languages and dialects spoken in
        the Philippines differ, but scholarly studies suggest that there are
        some 150. Most of the country’s languages are closely related, belonging
        to one of several subfamilies of Austronesian—more specifically, Western
        Malayo-Polynesian—languages. The major languages of the country
        generally correspond to the largest ethnic groups. Tagalog is the most
        widespread language of the Central Philippine subfamily, with the bulk
        of its native speakers concentrated in Manila, central and south-central
        Luzon, and the islands of Mindoro and Marinduque. The national language
        of the Philippines, Pilipino (also called Filipino), is based on Tagalog
        and shares a place with English (the lingua franca) as an official
        language and medium of instruction. Tagalog (including Pilipino) has the
        most extensive written literature of all Philippine languages. Cebuano,
        also a Central Philippine language, is used widely in Cebu, Bohol,
        eastern Negros, western Leyte, and parts of Mindanao. Ilocano is the
        most commonly spoken language of the Northern Luzon subfamily, and its
        speakers constitute the third largest language community of the
        Philippines. Other prominent languages of the Central Philippine group
        include Hiligaynon and Waray-Waray, both spoken in the Visayas, as well
        as several varieties of Bicol, spoken in southern Luzon. The language of
        the Tausug is widespread in both Palawan and the Sulu Archipelago, where
        it is used in Tausug as well as many non-Tausug communities. Similarly,
        the languages of the Kapampangans and Pangasinan, both of the Northern
        Philippine subfamily, have many speakers in central Luzon. Notable
        languages of the Southern Philippine subfamily are those spoken by the
        Maguindanao and Maranao of western Mindanao. <br />
